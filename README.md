Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, Liam, wanted Driver Pass to capture a corner of the market not yet tapped. They believed that an application or system that could allow driving students or hopeful drivers to study for all of their testing, take quizzes, and book driver's training with real instructors all from one website. They wanted this system to be accessible to all on PC, Mac, and smartphones.

What did you do particularly well?

I researched well into topics I did not know or understand.  Some of the more technical consulting portions of the project required me to delve deep into many different resources I had yet to see to hone in my knowledge on things I might have only been vaguely familiar with. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The object UML I created was not something I felt entirely confident about.  Object UMLs, in my opinion, can be very complicated and sometimes hard to envision when you aren't actually programming the application and can't really play around with inheritance and how the application might actually need to work.  I would probably spend some time testing a prototype application to better understand how my object UML could look. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were given during the interview we had with the client.  The client stated the basic desires they had for the system, and it was simple to interpret once I put myself in the shoes of a student or instructor using the platform.  I tried my best to envision how the average student would want this system to work for them, and how this system could become an easy place for instructors to use that may not be too technically apt. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software broadly at some times, and fine tuned at others.  I enjoy having an overarching large framework to look at, but tend to pick and choose more specific areas one at a time to refine and enhance as I go. Now that I have these new diagrams, I think I could see myself using them in the future in order to better visualize things I can't usually see in my head or in a large wall of code.
